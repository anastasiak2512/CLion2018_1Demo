# CLion 2018.1 Demo
Demo project for CLion 2018.1 for giving new features a try.

* Benefit from better C++ language support and more **C++17** features in a faster, more responsive editor.
* Speed up your development cycle with **CMake Install**.
* View single files and non-CMake projects in CLion, and load/unload CMake when necessary.
* Navigate around your code more efficiently with **code folding of control statements** and **breadcrumbs**.
* Work with **Objective-C / Objective-C++** in CLion with new dedicated support.
* Check plugins for **Fortran and Rust**.
* And even do the impossible – compile, debug, and run Linux-compatible binaries on Windows! Test them, and investigate memory errors with _Valgrind Memcheck_ – all thanks to **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, which is now supported in CLion.
